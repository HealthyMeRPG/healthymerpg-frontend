# HealthyMeRPG

HealthyMeRPG uses [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) API to use data gathered from supported fitness devices and applications to create a simple Role Playing Game (RPG), which rewards the user for meeting certain goals that contribute towards a healthy lifestyle. For example, a user may undergo a quest to take 10,000 steps in order to gain experience points and build up other attributes that will aggregate to an overall 
health score for the user avatar.
